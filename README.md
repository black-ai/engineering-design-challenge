# engineering-design-challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability and approach to designing functional objects for manufacturing. This challenge should take you 2-3 hours to complete, including an hour for research. 

# Introduction

You are tasked with designing an electronics enclosure for a small switch-mode power supply. The PSU takes in 240V AC from a mains outlet and outputs 12V DC for some other piece of electronics equipment. We have chosen the power supply, which we will provide limited details about below, and ask that you design / model an enclosure for mounting to either a wall or overhead metal cable trays. 

# The Power Supply
The part number for this power supply is CUS30M-12. We have included a .zip archive with 9 photos of the power supply from various angles. Download [here](https://github.com/black-ai/engineering-design-challenge/blob/master/images/black-engineering-challenge-images.zip).

# The Task

1.  Read the Requirements and Considerations section below. 
2.  Sketch and model an enclosure in your choice of CAD software for the above power supply.  
3.  Create a (public) git repository containing a .STEP file with your completed enclosure model, and a README.md file documenting the following: 
    - Any assumptions you made, and why. 
    - Any interesting design choices or considerations you made. 
    - Any final comments. 
4.  Send an email with a link to your repository to contact@black.ai with the subject line "ENG_CHALLENGE | <your_name>"

# Requirements and Considerations

1.  Your enclosure must allow for input via 240V mains power and an output of 12V.
2.  The enclosure must be manufacturable within one week and at a budget of $90 AUD. If you elect for 3D printing, you should consider this in a your design. Get a quick quote from a local manufacturing shop. 
3.  The power supply will produce heat. 
4.  The enclosure should be designed for ease of mounting on walls or overhead cable trays. 
5.  We have intentionally left out information (ie. psu specs) in this document. Get creative / figure it out.

# Have fun!
